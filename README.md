# LMR62014_5V_Boost_Converter

A 3.7V to 5V boost converter board using the LMR62014 chip.  Outputs a clean 5V from a 3.7V lipo pack with a compact footprint.  
I made it as a drop in replacement for a cheap Amazon board that was not only electrically noisey but also emitted an obnoxious audible whine.
